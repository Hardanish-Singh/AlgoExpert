                <p>
                        AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary
                        <strong>proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm</strong>
                        that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the metaverse to its
                        next major stage: <em>Web 4.0</em>. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of hoarding capital in
                        wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time of usage through our unique
                        point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your
                        chicken tenders cost 420 AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.

                <p>
                        Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We recommend starting out
                        by practicing on
                        <a href="https://algoexpert.io" target="_blank">AlgoExpert</a>. Next, once you feel you can
                        invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's time to ditch your fiat currency
                        and enter the future.
